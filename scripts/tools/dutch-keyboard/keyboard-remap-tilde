# This remaps ยง (0x64) on the Dutch keyboard to `~ (0x35) like the US keyboard.
# It also remaps the original `~ (0x35) to behave like a left shift (0xE1) to avoid
# accidentally pressing it.
#
# Using 0x29 instead of 0x35 would give you a real escape key
#
# You can clean this change with:
#   hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[{}]}'
#
# To make it "permanent", run:
#   ln -s $OH_MY_GIL_SH/scripts/tools/dutch-keyboard/keyboard-remap-tilde.plist "$HOME"/Library/LaunchAgents/
#   launchctl load "$HOME"/Library/LaunchAgents/keyboard-remap-tilde.plist
